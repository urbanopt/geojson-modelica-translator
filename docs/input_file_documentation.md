# Input File Documentation

There are two key input files that need to be defined to use the GeoJSON to Modelica Translator: a GeoJSON file and
a System Parameters file.

    As an aside, 5GDHC systems also require a `loop_order` JSON file, which is automatically generated by the [ThermalNetwork](https://nrel.github.io/ThermalNetwork/) package and used without any human input.

## GeoJSON Documentation

Presently only the building_properties.json of URBANopt's GeoJSON schemas is leveraged in the GMT.

### Building Properties

The building properties for the geojson file can be found in the `Schema` section of this documenation

## System Parameters Schema

The system parameter properties can be found in the `Schema` section of this documenation
